<li><p> Contact me at <a href="mailto:jose.araujo@ericsson.com">jose.araujo@ericsson.com</a> if you're interested in applying for internship or a master thesis project in my team. My team's goal is to solve some of the most relevant challenges in future devices, particularly focusing on developing new perception methods for Robotic Systems and Mixed Reality devices.</p>
</li>
</ul> 
<ul>
<li><p> I had the honor to be one of the commitee members of Dr. Mercedes Garcia Salguero's doctoral dissertation entitled “Certifiable Algorithms for 3D Computer Vision Problems” at the University of Málaga, together with Dr. Javier Civera and Dr. Francisco-Angel Moreno. Thank you Mercedes and Javier for your kind invitation. More details of Mercedes's work <a target="_blank" href="https://mapir.isa.uma.es/mapirwebsite/?p=3765"> here. </a> </p>

<li><p> We have been granted a WASP+VINNOVA Research Validation project on "System for Cooperative Perception and Navigation" <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vinnova.se/en/p/system-for-cooperative-perception-and-navigation/"> (link) </a> together with Michael Felsberg and Mårten Wadenbäck at the Computer Vision Laboratory (CVL) at Linköping University. We will validate methods for cross-modal cooperative perception and navigation using the challenging data captured in the unstructured WARA Public Safety environments. Additionally, we will use this data to generate a benchmark involving complex localization and navigation scenarios using multiple multi-modal agents. </p>

<h3>2019</h3>
<ul> 

<li><p> A research proposal on "DepDrone: Rigorously Investigating Drone Dependability" with Prof. Luca Mottola (RISE, P. Milano) has been accepted by VINNOVA - Pioneering ideas - Sustainable industry. </p>
</li>

<li><p> My team has demonstrated at Mobile World Congress 2019 how mixed reality, haptics and spatial audio can be combined to enable immersive communication between two persons when 5G is available. Users could remotely interact with each other in real-time and see, feel and hear virtual objects as if they were real. BBC Click covered our demo and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhuCJ4pXQRI&feature=youtu.be&t=823"> a video is available here. </a> </p>

<h3>2017</h3>
<ul> 
    <li><p> I was part of the team which demonstrated Ericsson's vision of the Internet of Skills enabled by 5G at the Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona. The demonstration focused on enabling a doctor to perform remote medical examinations by operating a robotic arm via a haptic glove. The demonstration was developed in a partnership with King's College London (UK), RoomOne labs (UK), Neurodigital (Spain) and British Telecom (UK). </p> 
        <p> The demonstration is covered in more detail <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ericsson.com/thinkingahead/the-networked-society-blog/2017/02/14/virtual-reality-comes-age-internet-skills/">in this blog post</a> and CNET published a story about it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/5g-not-just-speed-fifth-generation-wireless-tech-lets-you-do-vr-self-driving-cars-drones-remote/"> here</a>.
